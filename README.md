## Troubleshooting & Known Limitations

- **iOS is not supported** due to plugin and printing limitations.
- **Web printing**: Printing support in browsers may be limited or require additional configuration.
- **Bluetooth permissions**: On Android, ensure Bluetooth and Location permissions are granted for printer setup.
- **Database location**: On Windows, the database is stored in the app's working directory; on Android/Web, it's in the app data directory.
- **File import**: Only CSV and Excel files are supported for party master import.
- **Large data sets**: Performance may degrade with very large numbers of gatepasses or parties.
